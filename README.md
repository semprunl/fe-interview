X24Factory Frontend Take-Home Coding Exercise
=================================

This is a take-home coding exercise used to help evaluate and work
with candidates looking to join the team at X24Factory. The general idea
is for candidates to complete __one__ of the options below before the
engineering interview. During the interview we will use the code as a
discussion point and may ask you to make changes and re-submit for a
second interview.


### What you should expect?

We expect that the amount of effort to do any of these exercises is in
the range of about 4-6 hours of actual work. We also understand that
your time is valuable, and in anyone's busy schedule that constitutes
a fairly substantial chunk of time, so we really appreciate any effort
you put in to helping us building a solid team - and if you really
can't invest that much time, check out the F.A.Q. below for some
alternatives.

The requirements for each of the exercises form a reasonably formal
set of specifications for the component weâ€™re expecting you to
develop.  While they certainly have some holes in them and some
ambiguities, they are reasonably similar to the set of system
requirements programmers are often given.

After you submit your code, we will contact you to discuss and
potentially arrange an in-person interview with some of the team.

The interview will cover a wide range of technical and social aspects
relevant to working at X24Factory, but importantly for this exercise we
we will also take the opportunity to step through your submitted code
with you, offer feedback and we may ask you to re-submit your code for
a second time based on the feedback.


### What we are looking for?

Keep it simple. Really. 4-6 hours isn't a lot of time and we really
don't want you spending too much more time on it than that. It's more
important for us to see how you approach the problem rather then
solving it in its entirety.

__Treat it like production code__. That is, develop your software in
the same way that you would for any code that is intended to be
deployed to production. For example, if you would usually write tests
for your code then you should aim to do the same here. These may be
toy exercises, but we really would like to get an idea of how you
build code on a day-to-day basis.

You can submit the code in any way that is convenient for you - you
can email us a tarball, a pointer to download your code from somewhere
or just a pointer to a source control repository. In your submission,
you should include:

 - The code and what ever is required to run it. You can assume that
   this will __run on some *nix like operating system__ and will have a
   fairly standard set of command line tools. If you require something
   specific, either include it inline, or document it in a way that
   it would be trivial for us to get and run your code.

 - A small __README__ documenting the problem you are undertaking;
   documentation of any assumptions or simplifications you have made;
   and a short description of how to run your code.


Option 1: Newspaper/Magazine
--------------------

Build a newspaper/magazine website with 2 pages from these mockups: [fe-interview-opt1-mockups.zip](fe-interview-opt1-mockups.zip)

The first page is the homepage with a list of articles, and the second page is the article page, which contains content, related articles list, and comments section.

The dummy data needed for displaying on the site can be fetched from here: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/


Option 2: Substitute Your Own Project
-------------------------------------

Guidelines:

 - The project should be of at least 4 hours worth of effort.

 - It should be something you are comfortable discussing.

 - It should have a reasonably obvious purpose / use. At least
   something that you could explain to us in a couple of paragraphs of
   text (with the assumption you are explaining to experienced
   engineers).

 - It is something that has primarily been worked on by you.

To submit:

 - Your code.

 - If it is a larger project, a pointer to the most interesting parts
   that we can review and run.

 - A couple of paragraph description of what the code is/does.


F.A.Q.
------

1. Is it OK to share your solutions publicly?

 - Yes, the questions are not prescriptive, the process and discussion around
   the code is the valuable part.

 - You do the work, you own the code. Given we are asking you to give up your
   time, it is entirely reasonable for you to keep and use your solution as you
   see fit.


2. How should I submit?

 - However you see fit - you can email us a tarball, a pointer to download your
   code from somewhere or just a pointer to a source control repository.


3. Should I do X?

 - For any value of `X`, it is up to you, we intentionally leave the problems a
   little open-ended and will leave it up to you to provide us with what you
   see as important. Just remember the rough time-frame of the project, if it
   is going to take you a couple of days, it isn't essential.


4. I really don't have the time to spend on this project, but I would still like to apply.

 We really don't want this to introduce a bias against people that
 genuinely don't have time - and there are lots of reasons this may be
 the case. All we ask is that you make some effort to participate, a
 few options may be:

   - Take `Option 3` and show us something you already have.

   - Ask for more time to complete the exercise - we understand -
     just let us know.

   - Shrink the problem statement yourself. We would be more than
     happy to see a smaller (even tiny) solution where you have
     explicitly shrunk the problem to a scale that they can work with.

   - Just let us know, and we will see what we can do in terms of
     alternatives that will be less time-consuming.


5. Something is ambiguous, and I don't know what to do?

 The first thing is: don't get stuck. We really don't want to trip you
 up unintentionally, we are just attempting to see how you approach
 problems. That said, there are intentional ambiguities in the
 specification, partly to see how you fill in those gaps, and partly
 because the specification is written in English.

 If you really feel stuck, our first preference is for you to make a
 decision and document it with your submission - in this case there is
 really no wrong answer. If you feel it is not possible to do this,
 just send us an email and we will try to clarify or correct the
 question for you.
